**Hi, I am Bevane**

- 🎓 I am a Chemical Engineer and a self-taught Full-Stack Developer
- 👨🏼‍💻 I primarily code in Golang now (Three of my biggest projects are written in Golang!). I also am proficient in Typescript, Python and a bunch of different full-stack frameworks.

I like putting effort into writing elegant and maintainable code. Most of all I enjoy building things that are beneficial to people. Check out my pinned repos below!
